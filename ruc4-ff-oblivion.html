I know that a game‚Äôs subreddit is usually a bad place to voice criticism, but here we go. There are not enough keyblades in the game, and it is disappointing that the only non Disney themed Keyblade is Ultima weapon.

I finished the game yesterday and while I enjoyed it, I found that the pacing was off and it felt very backloaded story-wise. I didn't care much about the Disney worlds because they felt so disconnected and like a distraction from the real story of the game. So, I decided to mock up my own version of the first two acts of the game as a writing exercise for myself. Thoughts? ACT 1 ‚Ä¢ Same opening from 2.8 in Olympus.

I'm specifically asking about the technology used in the setting of the game, not the technology of the gameplay. I've noticed that prevalent IPs start to do this when they have been pretty well flushed out, but it can also simply be a narrative or style decision. Here are some examples I've noticed: Oblivion to Skyrim: We go forward an age, but technological improvement seems to be stalled at best.

It's now clear that you were wrong and Devin Funchess is the bum that I told you he was. I'm speaking specifically about this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/DynastyFF/comments/8cbd2x/thoughts_on_devin_funchess/ and a man named /u/ewizzle who said gt"He‚Äôs a WR1 ceiling with top WR2 floor at least." He also said gt"@ me during the season or after please" –î–ª—è –≤—ã–∑–æ–≤–∞ –∫–æ–Ω—Å–æ–ª–∏ –≤ Oblivion –≤–æ –≤—Ä–µ–º—è –∏–≥—Ä—ã –Ω–∞–∂–º–∏—Ç–µ –∫–ª–∞–≤–∏—à—É ~ (—Ç–∏–ª—å–¥–∞). –ü–æ—Å–ª–µ —ç—Ç–æ–≥–æ –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç–µ –≤–≤–æ–¥–∏—Ç—å —á–∏—Ç—ã ‚Äî –∫–æ–Ω—Å–æ–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ –∫–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥—ã –∏–≥—Ä—ã —Å –ø–æ–º–æ—â—å—é –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã—Ö –º–æ–∂–Ω–æ –≤–ª–∏—è—Ç—å. 
Sorry if this has been discussed already or if I‚Äôm just not seeing something. So I just finished the game last night and I was very happy with it. But not only are there still loose ends to tie up (Demyx, Vexen, Luxord‚Äôs wild card off the top of my head), but it seems the postgame is pretty disappointing. Besides lucky emblems, each world‚Äôs ‚Äúminigame‚Äù, and the new absent silhouette things (which aren‚Äôt even fun), is there anything to do after you beat Xehanort? No coliseum? No refightable. –°–º–æ—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç—å –æ–Ω–ª–∞–π–Ω —Ñ–∏–ª—å–º –û–±–ª–∏–≤–∏–æ–Ω (Oblivion) - –§–∞–Ω—Ç–∞—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Ç—Ä–∏–ª–ª–µ—Ä –æ –±—É–¥—É—â–µ–º —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞. –ù–∞ –ó–µ–º–ª—é –Ω–∞–ø–∞–ª–∏, –∏ —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ –≤—ã–∏–≥—Ä–∞–ª–æ –≤–æ–π–Ω—É, –Ω–æ –Ω–µ —Å–º–æ–≥–ª–æ —Å–ø–∞—Å—Ç–∏ –ó–µ–º–ª—é. Perhaps this is a complaint that ran its course shortly after launch but I think it's so egregious that I have to make a post about it. Why was this game so lacking in terms of non-Disney-related keyblades? Every cutscene with Riku I was going "Do I get Oblivion now?", when Roxas showed up I thought "Can I please get Two Become One now?" We didn't even get any BBS keyblades like Void Gear or Lost Memory. I get that this is an issue that is much easier to remedy –õ—É—á—à–∏–µ –º–æ–¥—ã –∏ –ø–ª–∞–≥–∏–Ω—ã –¥–ª—è Oblivion –≤ –Ω–∞—à–µ–º –∫–∞—Ç–∞–ª–æ–≥–µ. 
So this is old news to you guys But I felt really strange on this entire story bit. It cant be KH3 without Pixar? While I don't exactly feel the same way. I do so with the lack of FF. The games existance came from the conjoining of FF and Disney. But I've yet to see a single FF character, I understand that Radiant Garden isnt a officially listed world for KH3 that we know of. But I am really sad we havent seen a single cameo like Auron in Olympus in KH2. I think this is just me ranting. –î–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–π –º–æ–¥ –¥–µ–ª–∞–µ—Ç –¥–æ—Å—Ç—É–ø–Ω–æ–π –≤—Å—é –±—Ä–æ–Ω—é –≤ –∏–≥—Ä–µ, —Ç–∞–∫—É—é –∫–∞–∫ –±—Ä–æ–Ω—è –¥–≤–æ—Ä—Ü–æ–≤–æ–π —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–∂–∏, –¥—Ä–µ–º–æ—Ä –Ω–∏–∑—à–∏—Ö –∑–≤–∞–Ω–∏–π, –∑–æ–ª–æ—Ç—ã—Ö —Å–≤—è—Ç—ã—Ö, —Ç—ë–º–Ω—ã—Ö —Å–æ–±–ª–∞–∑–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π, –∞ —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ, –≤ –∑–∞–≤–∏—Å–∏–º–æ—Å—Ç–∏. Update: Edited to reflect everything still left versus what has sold. Sold stuff is at the bottom of the listing now. Thanks for looking at my listing! I have for sale over 100 first issues (one is a #0) of assorted recent series. Reading the initial issue of a comic can be a great way to get a feel for if you‚Äôll want to buy more of a series/purchase the trade, so I thought offering-up a bunch of recent-ish debuts would be fun for folk and help me in my continuing quest to make some space. –û–∫–∞–∑–∞–≤—à–∏—Å—å –≤ —Ç—é—Ä–µ–º–Ω–æ–π –∫–∞–º–µ—Ä–µ, –æ—Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä–∏—Ç–µ—Å—å. –î–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å —Ç—É—Ç –æ—Å–æ–±–µ–Ω–Ω–æ –Ω–µ—á–µ–≥–æ, –ø–æ—ç—Ç–æ–º—É –∏–¥–∏—Ç–µ –∫ —Ä–µ—à–µ—Ç–∫–µ, –∑–∞ –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–π –∑–∞–∫–ª—é—á–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –Ω–∞–ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤ –Ω–∞—á–Ω–µ—Ç –æ—Ç–ø—É—Å–∫–∞—Ç—å –≤ –≤–∞—à—É —Å—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–Ω—É. 
I love Kingdom Hearts, and have replayed all of them except Chain of Memories. So KH3 was probably one of my most anticipated games of maybe my whole life, however after beating it, 15 years of waiting for a very average game is unacceptable. My problems(short and simple) amp#x200B; 1. Toy Story world ending was depressing as fuck, we never got to reunite the toys with Andy, and we never revisited them like in previous KH games 2. Tangled, we were as useless as useless –ò–Ω–æ–ø–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç–Ω—ã–µ –∞–≥—Ä–µ—Å—Å–æ—Ä—ã –≤ –æ—á–µ—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–æ–π —Ä–∞–∑ –∞—Ç–∞–∫–æ–≤–∞–ª–∏ –ó–µ–º–ª—é. –ß–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤—É —Å –Ω–µ–∏–º–æ–≤–µ—Ä–Ω—ã–º —Ç—Ä—É–¥–æ–º —É–¥–∞–ª–æ—Å—å –æ—Ç—Å—Ç–æ—è—Ç—å –ø—Ä–∞–≤–æ –Ω–∞ –∂–∏–∑–Ω—å. –ù–æ —É—â–µ—Ä–±, –ø—Ä–∏—á–∏–Ω—ë–Ω–Ω—ã–π –∏–Ω–æ–ø–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç—è–Ω–∞–º–∏. After finishing Kingdom Hearts 3, there was a lot left to be desired for me. Some of this can't be fixed (plot progression, rushed ending, Disney world implementation) but there are a lot of things that I think could be added on to this game to make it loads better. I want to share my ideas and see what ideas others might have for improving the game. 1. Riku's Story DLC. One of my biggest expectations for KH3 was being able to play Riku's story. We've been able to play multiple story lines. –ñ–∏–∑–Ω—å –≤ –¥—Ä—É–≥–æ–º –º–∏—Ä–µ, –∏–ª–∏ –ö–∞–∫ –Ω–µ —Å–¥–æ—Ö–Ω—É—Ç—å –æ—Ç –ø–µ—Ä–≤–æ–≥–æ –ª–∏—á–∞. –ü—Ä–æ–∫–∞—á–∫–∞ –ø–µ—Ä—Å–æ–Ω–∞–∂–µ–π. –ó–¥—Ä–∞–≤—Å—Ç–≤—É–π—Ç–µ, –¥–æ—Ä–æ–≥–∏–µ –ª—é–±–∏—Ç–µ–ª–∏ –º–∏—Ä–∞ The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion, –∞ —Ç–∞–∫ –∂–µ –º–∞–Ω—á–∫–∏–Ω—ã (–∫–∞–∫ —è, –∞–≥–∞. –ö–∞–∫ —è–≤—Å—Ç–≤—É–µ—Ç –∏–∑ —Å–≤–µ–∂–µ–≥–æ —Ñ–∏–Ω–∞–Ω—Å–æ–≤–æ–≥–æ –æ—Ç—á–µ—Ç–∞ Take-Two Interactive, RPG The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion –Ω–µ –≤—ã–π–¥–µ—Ç –≤ 2005 –≥–æ–¥—É - –Ω–∏ –¥–ª—è –†–°, –Ω–∏ –¥–ª—è –õ—É—á—à–∞—è —Ä–æ–ª–µ–≤–∞—è –∏–≥—Ä–∞ 2006-–≥–æ –≥–æ–¥–∞ –ø–æ –≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏–∏ PlayGround.ru. –°–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª—è—é—â–∏–µ —á–∞—Å—Ç–∏ —ç—Ç–æ–≥–æ —É—Å–ø–µ—Ö–∞ - –æ–≥—Ä–æ–º–Ω–µ–π—à–∏–π –º–∏—Ä, –≤ –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–º –≤—Å–µ–≥–¥–∞ –µ—Å—Ç—å —á–µ–º –∑–∞–Ω—è—Ç—å—Å—è, –ø–æ–ª–Ω–∞—è —Å–≤–æ–±–æ–¥–∞ –¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏–π. 31 —è–Ω–≤–∞—Ä—è –≤ Rangers of Oblivion –±—É–¥–µ—Ç –¥–æ—Å–ø—É—Ç–Ω–æ –Ω–æ–≤–æ–µ —Å–æ–±—ã—Ç–∏–µ! –†–µ–π–Ω–¥–∂–µ—Ä–∞ –≤—ã—à–µ 40 —É—Ä–æ–≤–Ω—è –≠–¥–∏—Ç –ø—Ä–∏–≥–ª–∞—à–∞–µ—Ç –ø—Ä–∏—Å–æ–µ–¥–∏–Ω–∏—Ç—å—Å—è –∫ –ë–∏—Ç–≤–∞–º –ü—Ä–æ—à–ª–æ–≥–æ.
